Project Plan: Nurturing and Stabilizing Personality Seeds in Language Models
Overview
This project aims to build a robust system for nurturing personality seeds and stabilizing them within language models (LMs). By integrating biological formalisms into prompt optimization tasks, the project seeks to enhance the interpretability and robustness of LMs against mutations such as typos and noise. The ultimate goal is to develop a genotype-phenotype benchmark that can optimize LM abilities and ensure reliable performance in precision medicine and other critical applications.
Research Objectives
Categorization of Genotypes and Mutational Profiles
Hypothesis: Categorizing genotypes and mutational profiles will provide a functional and interpretable toolbox for optimizing LM abilities.
Specific Aims:
Survey and systemize prompt mutations and genes.
Evaluate the effects of mutations on LM genes.
Construct a benchmark for LM robustness to mutation.
Methodology and Originality
Automated Gene Identification and Annotation: Develop a system to identify and annotate gene structures within prompts using semantic segmentation.
Mutational Space Exploration: Systematically search the mutational space to understand the relative effects of different mutations on prompt outputs.
Genotype-Phenotype Benchmarking: Utilize genotype-phenotype robustness measurements to establish upper and lower bounds for mutation techniques and prompts.
Pertinence and Innovation
Beyond State of the Art: Surpass existing interpretability of input prompt structures and initial condition setting during prompt optimization.
Population Genetics Integration: Incorporate lessons from population genetics to enhance LM research, providing predictable mappings for mutations.
Relevance to Key Research Areas
Explainable AI in Precision Medicine (5.2): Enhance LM robustness in interpreting patient reports and notes, reducing bias in data presentation.
Beyond Supervised Learning (1.3): Improve inferential capabilities of LMs in handling imperfect language inputs, critical for automated medical systems.
